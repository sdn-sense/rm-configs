  port: "Ethernet22" # Where is it connected? Either you know it, or (on router check lldp neigbors and match mac table). Or run lldpd daemon on host, and do lldpcli show neighbors. I checked dtn-01 on the router based on the mac address

In most cases, this matches same vlan range, that FE configures on the switch. You can be selective and tell only specific vlans are allowed.

  policy: hostlevel # Given your public IPs for XRootD are set at the host level (macvlan1,2,3...) this is then hostlevel. In case privatens are used (either kube multus or docker) - this would be privatens then. For Private NS, see example here:T2_US_SDSC/Agent01/main.yaml
